<h4>Do you use Piwigo Client on your android device?</h4>
If so, this plugin will expose more of the standard Piwigo website functionality to the PiwigoClient app.

<p>
<h4>Do I need this plugin?</h4>
This plugin exposes features within Piwigo that are available through the standard website, but have been omitted from the web services which
clients such as PiwigoClient (Android) use to allow browsing and administration in an alternative way.
Ideally, all features included within this plugin will be added to the main Piwigo server in a future release, but I have no control over whether or when that will happen.
Until it does, this plugin circumvents that problem.

<h4>Features this plugin adds:</h4>
<ul class="square-list">
  <li>View your own rating for photos</li>
  <li>Mark or unmark photos as being a personal favorite</li>
  <li>Clear your favorites list</li>
  <li>Record access to your piwigo server by users of the WS Functions API (e.g. PiwigoClient users)</li>
  <li>View and manage orphaned photos</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Important note</h4>
If you stop using the Piwigo Client app, you may wish to disable or delete this plugin from your server too.
