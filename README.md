Piwigo is photo gallery software for the web, built by an active community of users and developers.

Extensions make Piwigo easily customizable. Icing on the cake, Piwigo is free and open source.

## What is this project?
 
This project extends the WS (web service) functions provided by the piwigo server to allow fuller control of the server using remote clients.

## Why?

This project has been created to increase the level of functionality for users of the android app I develop - PiwigoClient.
Use of this plugin is not a requirement if you want to use the PiwigoClient, but it does enrich the capability.

## Requirements

Piwigo 2.9.4 is highly recommended as a minimum - earlier versions may not be fully compatible (untested - use at your risk!).

Piwigo 2.9.4+ may already have these functions as they have been submitted to the piwigo team as a pull request. Adding this plugin will not cause conflicts though.

## Install

Install as for any other PIWIGO plugin

## License

Piwigo is released under the GPL v2 license so this plugin has also been released under that license.

## Extending this plugin

If you want to extend it, please submit a pull request to this github repo rather than just forking a new plugin though.
If you don't know how to fork and submit PRs, please do a google search, it's a lot simpler than you may think!
